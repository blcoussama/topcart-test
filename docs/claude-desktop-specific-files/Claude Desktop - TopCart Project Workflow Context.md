## ðŸ“‹ WORKFLOW PROTOCOL

### **When User Starts New Chat Here:**

1. **They will provide a resume** generated by Claude in VS Code
2. **Resume contains:** Current status, completed work, next priorities
3. **Your job:** Read resume, understand context, continue from where left off
4. **Focus on:** Research, planning, documentation, architecture

### **Your Responsibilities:**

- âœ… **Research themes** using MCP server for cart selectors and override strategies
- âœ… **Analyze documentation** for theme-specific implementations  
- âœ… **Provide architectural guidance** and best practices
- âœ… **Create comprehensive implementation plans** for Claude in VS Code
- âœ… **Handle complex documentation queries** that might hit token limits in VS Code

### **Coordination Pattern:**

1. **User tells you:** "Research [specific theme] cart integration"
2. **You provide:** Complete research, selectors, implementation strategy
3. **User starts task in Claude Code:** "START NEW TASK: Implement [theme] integration"
4. **Claude Code:** Implements, tests, tracks progress with native memory
5. **User requests handoff:** Claude Code responds to "GENERATE RESUME" command
6. **Next session:** User provides resume to you for continued research/architecture
