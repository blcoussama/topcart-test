# UpCart Clone - Technical Specification

## Comprehensive Summary of All Validated & Refined Requirements

*This document contains all technical requirements, architectural decisions, and implementation details discovered through comprehensive analysis using Shopify's official MCP documentation server.*

---

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE & HOSTING MODEL

### **Critical Correction: Hosting Responsibilities**

- ✅ **Theme App Extensions**: Hosted by Shopify (cart modal, UI components)
- ✅ **Backend Application**: Hosted by developer (database, admin interface, API endpoints)
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Hosted by developer (merchant configuration interface)

### **Development Infrastructure Requirements**

```javascript
const hostingModel = {
  shopifyHosted: [
    "Theme App Extension files (cart modal UI)",
    "App blocks and sections",
    "Frontend JavaScript and CSS"
  ],
  
  developerHosted: [
    "Backend API server (Node.js, Python, etc.)",
    "Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)",
    "Admin dashboard (merchant settings)",
    "Webhook handlers",
    "Authentication system"
  ]
};
```

---

## 🔐 API PERMISSIONS & SCOPES

### **Minimal Core Permissions (Phase 1)**

```javascript
const corePermissions = {
  required: ["read_products"],  // ✅ CORRECTED: Single minimal scope
  
  // REMOVED: write_themes, read_script_tags, etc.
  rationale: "Theme App Extensions don't require extensive API access"
};
```

### **Enhanced Features Permissions (Phase 2+)**

```javascript
const enhancedPermissions = {
  subscriptions: [
    "read_products",
    "write_products",                    // ✅ CORRECTED: Required for selling plans
    "write_own_subscription_contracts"   // ✅ CORRECTED: For subscription management
  ],
  
  analytics: [
    "read_analytics",                    // ✅ NEW: Essential for comprehensive analytics
    "read_orders",                       // ✅ NEW: Required for revenue attribution
    "read_customers"                     // ✅ NEW: For customer behavior analytics
  ],
  
  customerData: [
    "read_customers",
    "write_customers"  // For customer portal features
  ]
};
```

## 📅 2025 API COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### **Critical: Instruction Checking Implementation**

```javascript
// ✅ REQUIRED: All cart modifications must check instructions
const cartOperationsCompliance = {
  beforeAnyCartModification: async () => {
    const hasInstructions = await checkCartInstructions();
    if (!hasInstructions) {
      throw new Error('Cart operations not available in this context');
    }
  },
  
  implementation: {
    addToCart: "Check instructions before adding items",
    updateQuantity: "Check instructions before quantity changes",
    applyDiscounts: "Check instructions before discount application",
    addProtection: "Check instructions before protection toggle"
  }
};
```

### **Queue-Based Cart Operations**

```javascript
// ✅ ENHANCED: Prevent race conditions with operation queuing
class CartOperationQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = [];
    this.processing = false;
  }
  
  async queueOperation(operation) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.queue.push({ operation, resolve, reject });
      this.processQueue();
    });
  }
  
  async processQueue() {
    if (this.processing || this.queue.length === 0) return;
    
    this.processing = true;
    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const { operation, resolve, reject } = this.queue.shift();
      
      try {
        // Check instructions before each operation
        const hasInstructions = await checkCartInstructions();
        if (!hasInstructions) {
          throw new Error('Cart instructions prevent this operation');
        }
        
        const result = await operation();
        resolve(result);
      } catch (error) {
        reject(error);
      }
    }
    this.processing = false;
  }
}
```

## 🚫 CRITICAL SHOPIFY POLICY COMPLIANCE

### **Section 1.19: No Auto-Add Paid Items**

```javascript
const policyCompliance = {
  shippingProtection: {
    oldBehavior: "Auto-add protection to cart",        // ❌ PROHIBITED
    correctedBehavior: "Explicit customer consent",    // ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    implementation: {
      defaultState: "unchecked",
      explicitAction: "Customer must click toggle",
      visualClarity: "Clear pricing and description"
    }
  },
  
  allPaidAddons: {
    rule: "Customer must explicitly add any non-free items",
    impact: "Better trust, lower opt-in rates but compliant"
  }
};
```

    upgradeFlow: `
      // Remove one-time purchase line item
      await cart.removeItem(existingLineKey);
      
      // Add subscription version with selling plan
      await cart.addItem({
        variant_id: variantId,
        quantity: quantity,
        selling_plan: sellingPlanId
      });
    `
  }

  },
  
  benefits: {
    performance: "No external font loading",
    consistency: "Matches theme typography automatically", 
    gdprCompliance: "No third-party font requests"
  }
};
```

### **4. Cart API Integration - Enhanced Error Handling**

```javascript
const cartAPICorrections = {
  endpoints: {
    add: "/cart/add.js",
    change: "/cart/change.js", 
    get: "/cart.js",

    try {
      await checkCartInstructions();
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.message.includes('instructions')) {
        // Redirect to checkout for complex operations
        window.location.href = '/checkout';
      } else {
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
};
```
